# 💱 Currency Prediction Project

Welcome to the **Currency Prediction** repository!

## 📌 Project Overview

Each student is expected to implement a machine learning model that predicts the value of a specific currency.

An example implementation is available in the [`/example`](./example) directory to help you get started.

## 📁 Project Structure

Your code should follow this structure:

* `tools/pred.py`
  ➤ Place your **ML algorithms** here. This file should contain **only functions** (no script code).

* `tools/data_reader.py`
  ➤ Add your **data loading and preprocessing functions** here.

* `data/`
  ➤ Store your **currency data files** in this directory.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Semillero-Inteligencia-Artificial-EAFIT/Currency-prediction
   ```

2. Explore the `/example` folder to understand the expected structure and usage.

3. Add your own functions to `tools/pred.py` and `tools/data_reader.py`.

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to open **pull requests** to share your improvements, models, or preprocessing techniques.
